## Udacity Bikeshare Python Project

### Date created
10 July 2023

### Description
This project used basic Python programming principles to interact with a user and allow them to see information about bikeshare data from Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The data provided was from January to June of 2017.

The key data fields included in the CSV files were as follows:
* Start Time
* End Time
* Trip Duration
* Start Station
* End Station
* User Type
* Gender
* Birth Year (NOTE:  The "washingon.csv" file did not have a Birth Year data field)

The bikeshare project interacts with the user by asking the user to specify a city to explore, the month(s) of interest, and then filter criteria based on time (month, day of week, both, or no time filters). Once the program receives the appropriate information, it then displays some basic statistics and information from the bikeshare data based on the user's input. 

### Files used
The main file that was used to create the project was:  "bikeshare.py"

There were supporting CSV files that are not in this repo due to the size of those files. The names of those files were:
* "chicago.csv"
* "new_york_city.csv"
* "wasington.csv"

### Credits
Many thanks to the Udacity GitHub course that taught students introductory information about version control!
